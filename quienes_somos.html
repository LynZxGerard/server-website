        <p>It all started with a group of friends who found a shared passion and began coming together to enjoy it. As time passed,
        they realized the importance of creating a community for others who also wanted to learn languages. In 2021, the Spanish
        English Learning Café was born, bringing together people from all over the world.</p>
